## Setup

To setup the application

1. Fork and clone the project to your machine
2. `npm install`. This will also install the application *Cypress.io* for running browser integration tests

The project expects you have the Spaced repetition API project setup and running on http://localhost:8000.

Find instructions to setup the API here https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/spaced-repetition-api.

## Running project

This is a `create-react-app` project so `npm start` will start the project in development mode with hot reloading by default.
